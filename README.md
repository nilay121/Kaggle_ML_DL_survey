# Kaggle_ML_DL_survey
<h2> About data </h2>
Kaggle Machine Learning & Deep Learning survey 2021. It contains 42+ questions and 25,973 responses. <br>
Responses to multiple choice questions (only a single choice can be selected) were recorded in individual columns. Responses to multiple selection questions (multiple choices can be selected) were split into multiple columns (with one column per answer choice), i.e they are one hot encoded. <br><br>

<h2> Analyzing the data </h2>
Our main task is to analyze the data and find out the different traits in data and answer some of the questions using visualization and plots. Some of the important information from the dataset are discussed below :
<ul>
<li>The number of males in data science and ML sector is more than the female and other gender by a pretty big margin. India has the greatest number of data dcience professionals or students. This means we can expect India to become as a data science hub in the mere future. Data Scientist is the most liked role followed software engineer. The greater number of data scientists in the world have a master's degree.<br>

<br>
<li> Python is by far the popular programming language for data scientists followed by R and SQL.
<li> The most favourite IDE is Jupyter notebook followed by VS Code and Pycharm. However, many people also use google colab and kaggle notebooks because they have similar interface as jupyter notebook, and theyalso provide with free GPU and TPU service upto a limit, which might be very beneficial for small projects and for begineers.
<li> Scikit-learn, keras and pytorch are the most popular framework, however though xg boost is a boosting library yet it gives tough competition to the state of the art frameworks like keras and torch.<br>
